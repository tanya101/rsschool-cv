## **About myself** 

I always loved studying foreign languages, i.e. English, Spanish, French, and one day I thought what if I try one more - the one to talk to mashines. It's pretty interesting and has a lot of pleasant pros, especially the lack of misunderstanding, which exist in human relations. Today I'm at the very start, and hope to learn many useful information from this course.

## **Work experience** 

My work experience is far away from IT, except the one job where I tought adults to type blindly and to use professional programs (EMIAS, Excel, Word) at work. Still not IT, but at least something connected to computers. Also due to this work today I can blind type, and that skill helps me alot. 

## **Education and courses** 

I have two degrees in psychology and translating (English).

## **Languages** 

* English B1-B2
* French A1
