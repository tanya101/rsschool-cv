## **About myself** 

Hi, I'm Tanya, and this is my third start of this course. Previously I tried Stage#1 and Stage#0, but hadn't finished either. This time I am going to complete at least Stage#1, cause finally I have more free time and definately more motivation.

## **Code example**

`const explode = s => s.split('').map(num => num.repeat(num)).join('');`

## **Work experience** 

My work experience is far away from IT, except the one job where I tought adults to type blindly and to use professional programs (EMIAS, Excel, Word) at work. Still not IT, but at least something connected to computers. Also due to this work today I can blind type, and that skill helps me alot. 

## **Education and courses** 

I have two degrees in psychology and translating (English).

Half of Stage#0, which means base of HTML, CSS and JS.

Also I studied algorithms by myself (e.g. 'Grokking Algorithms' book, learn.javascript.ru) and now can solve CodeWars katas up to 6 kyu.

## **Languages** 

* English B2
* French A1
